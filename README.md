# Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Robot in ROS 2

## üìå Overview
This project implements a **custom robot** that performs **autonomous navigation using Nav2** in **Gazebo** while avoiding **dynamic obstacles**.

## üõ† Features
‚úÖ Autonomous Navigation with ROS 2 Nav2  
‚úÖ Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance  
‚úÖ Custom C++ Node for Navigation (`navigation_node`)  
‚úÖ RViz Visualization  
‚úÖ Gazebo Simulation

## Installation & Setup
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start Simulation
```bash
ros2 launch bot_gazebo spawn_robot.launch.xml
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Start Navigation
```bash
ros2 launch bot_nav navigation.launch.xml
```
### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Start Rviz
```bash
rviz2
```
### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Navigation node
```bash
ros2 run bot_nav navigation_node
```
## How navigation_node Works
The ROS 2 C++ node (navigation_node) is responsible for managing navigation goals interactively.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Initial Pose:

The node sets an initial pose estimate to localize the robot in the simulated world.
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Send a Navigation Goal:

The user enters a target location (x, y, yaw), and the node sends this as a goal to the Nav2 stack.
#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Print "Goal Reached" When Goal is Achieved:

Once the robot reaches the target location, "Goal Reached" is printed in the terminal.
#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt for Next Goal:

After reaching the goal, the user is prompted to enter a new target location.
The process repeats until the user decides to exit.

## Expected Terminal Output
```bash
[INFO] [navigation_node]: Setting initial pose...
Enter new goal (x, y, yaw):  2.0 3.5 1.57
[INFO] [navigation_node]: Navigating to (2.0, 3.5, 1.57)...
